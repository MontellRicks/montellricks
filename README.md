I'm a passionate cybersecurity professional who enjoys diving into complex challenges through hands-on projects. My background includes extensive front-end and back-end experience with HR and HRIS systems, as well as tools like Azure, Tenable, Sentinel, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This expertise was developed through roles at Fortune 500 companies such as Amazon.com, the University of California, and organizations in the healthcare and union sectors—where regulatory compliance and data protection are paramount. This experience has given me a strong foundation in aligning technical solutions with strict compliance requirements. My projects—spanning vulnerability management, threat detection, and more—reflect my commitment to enhancing security operations and staying ahead in the fast-paced cybersecurity landscape. Feel free to explore my work to see how I’ve applied these skills in real-world scenarios.
